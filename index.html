        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>What is the Redevelopment Plan?</h3>
            <p>The redevelopment and repair plan includes the proposed demolition of buildings #7 and #9 to be replaced with a new accessible and energy efficient apartment building of approximately 40 units. Necessary repairs and renovations to the existing buildings are also part of the plan. Please note that the redevelopment and repair plans are still in the planning stage and are subject to change. Final decisions will be based on consultation with the Norris Crescent Housing Co-op membership.</p>      
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Why is it Necessary?</h3>
        <p>Norris Co-op was built in the 1940â€™s and is in serious need of very expensive and necessary capital repairs to ensure its long-term sustainability and safety. Besides basic repairs the co-op requires greater accessibility to allow residents to age-in-place and to assist residents with mobility issues. Greater accessibility assists all residents and visitors. It is also important that Norris Co-op is preserved to ensure the ongoing provision of housing affordability for the south Etobicoke community</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>What will it Cost? How will we Pay for it?</h3>
        <p>The redevelopment details and scope of work is still in the planning stage and final costs are still to be determined. The funding for the redevelopment will come from a variety of sources, such as, equity from the possible sale of building #24, the waiver of various City charges including development charges, planning fees, and property tax deferment (already approved). The co-op is also eligible to obtain a low-interest loan and capital grants through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).  In addition, the co-op will seek to access capital funding through newly announced Federal Government programs to fund new affordable co-op housing. It remains the primary commitment of the co-op to maintain housing affordability for all members and to ensure the redevelopment does not adversely impact residents financially.  All financial costs for the redevelopment will require the approval of the co-op membership.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Will I Lose My Home due to the Redevelopment?</h3>
        <p>No, however some households will need to be temporarily relocated in order to demolish buildings #7 and #9 and accommodate the proposed sale of building #24.  The Norris Co-op has strongly stated that no household will be financially adversely impacted and all temporarily displaced households will be given priority to move back into Norris Co-op once construction is completed. It is also the goal to stage the redevelopment, to permit, if possible, the transfer of displaced households on-site to the newly built apartment units. Impacted members will be involved throughout the relocation process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>What is the Timeline?</h3>
        <p>Since the Norris Co-op redevelopment plans involves adding residential units it requires a rezoning approval from the City of Toronto.  It is anticipated that rezoning approval and other City approvals, such as site plan and building permit can be obtained by Spring/Summer 2023 with construction start soon after. If these timelines are maintained, then construction completion could happen in 2025.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h3>How can we be Involved?</h3>
        <p>It is important that all members of Norris Housing Co-op are actively involved and consulted throughout the redevelopment process. New members are welcome to attend the Development Sub-Committee where the redevelopment plans are discussed. The co-op also plans to arrange a number of opportunities for co-op members to become involved and to be informed, such as, drop-in sessions, meetings, social gatherings, questions and answers updates, distributing newsletters, handouts and updating the co-op website.</p>
        <p>Norris Crescent Housing Co-op is our home and the redevelopment plan will only be successful if everyone is involved and plays a part.</p>
